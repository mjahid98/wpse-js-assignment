Problem 4: Create a function isPrime that takes a number as a parameter and returns true if it's a prime number, and false otherwise.

Answers to Theoretical Questions:

1. Explain the difference between 'if...else' and 'switch' statements for conditional logic.
- 'if...else' statements are used when you have multiple conditions that need to be checked. They provide more flexibility and can evaluate expressions of any type.
- 'switch' statements are a cleaner way to write a block of 'if' statements that all test the same expression. It is usually more efficient and easier to read, especially for simple conditions based on the value of a single variable.

2. What is JavaScript, and what is its primary purpose in web development?
- JavaScript is a programming language that runs in the browser and can be used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. It works alongside HTML and CSS to enhance the functionality and user experience on websites. But nowadays JS is also used in various other fields as well like backend development, machine learning, embeded systems etc. So, it's becoming more general purpose.

3. Explain the difference between var, let, and const when declaring variables in JavaScript.
- 'var' declarations are globally scoped or function scoped, and they are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with 'undefined'.
- 'let' and 'const' are block-scoped. 'let' allows you to reassign values, while 'const' does not.
- 'const' is used to declare constants; values that are not supposed to change throughout the execution of the program.

4. Explain the concept of "scope" in JavaScript and the difference between global and local scope.
- Scope in JavaScript refers to the visibility or accessibility of variables.
- Global scope means the variable is available throughout the program, whereas local scope means the variable is only accessible within a specific function or block of code.

5. What is the difference between "null" and "undefined" in JavaScript?
- 'null' is an assignment value that represents no value or no object. It implies that the variable has been set to something that has no value.
- 'undefined' means a variable has been declared but not defined yet. It is also a value automatically assigned to variables that are just declared, or to formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.
